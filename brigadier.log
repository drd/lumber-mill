2008/01/09 19:49:01 <ambethia> yo tyler
2008/01/09 20:06:44 <filmprog> hello
2008/01/10 09:52:58 <fleas> damn that spam bot :)
2008/01/10 09:53:37 * fleas finally broke down and bought a new mac pro.. (Now what I am to do with my old one which is only a little over a year old)
2008/01/10 09:53:48 * fleas dances until the bill comes
2008/01/10 09:59:43 <fleas> I really have no idea how much I should sell my old Mac Pro for now...
2008/01/10 09:59:58 <fleas> I should have sold it last month when someone offered me 2800.00 for it.
2008/01/10 10:00:21 <gavinstark> That would have been a good price.  Did you get the new one?  (I did....)
2008/01/10 10:00:27 <fleas> yeah
2008/01/10 10:00:35 <fleas> well my old one isn't really old per say
2008/01/10 10:01:10 <fleas> (Mac Pro 2.66/2 dual-core 4GB RAM, 750GB HDD, 2 DVD optical)
2008/01/10 10:01:26 <fleas> How much you think I should list that on craigslist... ?
2008/01/10 10:01:48 <gavinstark> Given that you have both, how would you compare the fan noise when the machine is idle?  As this is my first Mac desktop I'm not sure if I should be expecting total silence or not (its REALLY quiet, but not silent)
2008/01/10 10:02:02 <fleas> I don't have it yet
2008/01/10 10:02:04 <fleas> do you?
2008/01/10 10:02:04 <gavinstark> I think you could do some research on eBay auctions that completed and get a sense of price.
2008/01/10 10:02:21 <gavinstark> Do I what?
2008/01/10 10:02:24 <fleas> gavinstark: the ebay auction prices are being quoted high because the new just came out
2008/01/10 10:02:37 <fleas> did you get a new mac pro already and do you have possession of it?
2008/01/10 10:02:43 <gavinstark> I think you can go back a few months.
2008/01/10 10:02:44 <fleas> Mine has not shipped yet..
2008/01/10 10:02:56 <gavinstark> Yeah, I ordered it at 11:30 on Tuesday and it hit my front door the same time yesterday.... ;-)
2008/01/10 10:03:08 <fleas> in less than a day?
2008/01/10 10:03:14 <fleas> WOW!@
2008/01/10 10:03:32 <fleas> so you didn't upgrade to NVidia 8800GT then ..
2008/01/10 10:03:34 <fleas> me either
2008/01/10 10:03:42 <gavinstark> Nope, stock config.
2008/01/10 10:03:45 <fleas> I bought mine last night at 1am laying in bed
2008/01/10 10:04:45 <gavinstark> ;-)  See my blog:    http://hasmanyquestions.wordpress.com
2008/01/10 10:04:56 <fleas> gavinstark: I upgraded to the 3.0 procs
2008/01/10 10:05:01 <gavinstark> I ordered mine before Apple could send me the "Hey, come buy our new stuff..."
2008/01/10 10:05:14 <fleas> plus a few other things minor ..
2008/01/10 10:05:22 <fleas> I'll order ram from OWC later today
2008/01/10 10:05:29 <gavinstark> I wasn't sure the extra $$ was going to be worth it.  I don't do heavy duty CPU items and 2.8 x 8 should be plenty.  ;-)
2008/01/10 10:05:41 <fleas> you can get 4GB (2gb x 2 for under $300.00_
2008/01/10 10:06:00 <fleas> gavinstark: I gotta  pretty big discount, otherwise I would have went stock too
2008/01/10 10:06:21 <gavinstark> I saw that for these we have to get the FB-DIMMs (Fully Buffered) models.
2008/01/10 10:06:44 <fleas> Apple gave me about $800.00 off the price, plus I cashed in all my credit card rewards.. which totalled $350.00
2008/01/10 10:06:51 <fleas> that was my rationalization.
2008/01/10 10:07:17 <fleas> yeah, OWC has two type of RAM .. "certified by apple" and "Not certified by apple"
2008/01/10 10:07:19 <gavinstark> Thats awesome.  How did you get Apple to give you the $800? ;-)
2008/01/10 10:07:31 <fleas> select member :)
2008/01/10 10:07:44 <fleas> I've had a developer key for about a year
2008/01/10 10:07:52 <fleas> just never used it, was waiting for the new mac pro :)
2008/01/10 10:08:44 <fleas> gavinstark:  so are you saying your machine is not extremely quiet?
2008/01/10 10:09:59 <gavinstark> It is very quiet, but in a silent room with the machine under the desk right next to me I can just make out the fan sound.  Its just loud enough that you can hear it.  Just on the edge where you'd say "Gee, you should have made it louder so I couldn't complain that it was NEARLY silent, or totally silent."
2008/01/10 10:10:17 <fleas> lol
2008/01/10 10:10:25 <fleas> that sounds about right...
2008/01/10 10:10:39 <gavinstark> A coworker has a G5 at his disk and a previous gen MacPro at home, I might bring it in for him to compare.  He moved to the MacPro from the G5 because of fan noise.
2008/01/10 10:10:42 <fleas> this is my third mac desktop
2008/01/10 10:11:03 <fleas> YES! I started with the G5 and it was a disaster.. not to mention a ton of kernel panics
2008/01/10 10:11:13 <fleas> sometimes the fans would make it sound like it was going to fly away
2008/01/10 10:11:26 <fleas> I dumped that for the first Mac Pro Intel
2008/01/10 10:11:39 <fleas> which I am not dumping for the new one when it gets here.
2008/01/10 10:11:53 <fleas> I've got about $4000.00 in this one though
2008/01/10 10:11:56 <gavinstark> Thats what he said (about the fan noise)
2008/01/10 10:12:07 <fleas> gavinstark: thank god apple went to intel
2008/01/10 10:12:09 <fleas> :)
2008/01/10 10:12:18 <fleas> or just thank whoever...
2008/01/10 10:12:21 <fleas> Jobs?
2008/01/10 10:13:11 <fleas> gavinstark: You didn't say very much about your Mac Pro on your blog?
2008/01/10 10:13:14 <fleas> *grins
2008/01/10 10:13:44 <fleas> However, I feel the same way too.. .maybe on MacWorld they will offer Blu-Ray drives as an option
2008/01/10 10:13:51 <gavinstark> I got it yesterday, had a chance to power it on and do a few things before going to the meetup last night.  Didn't get home until 11:30....
2008/01/10 10:13:53 <fleas> which I wouldn't get anyhow.
2008/01/10 10:14:08 <fleas> gavinstark:  try compiling KDE4 on it :)
2008/01/10 10:14:48 <fleas> one of the first things I am going to do .. is setup a bootcamp partition and dual-boot osx and linux :)
2008/01/10 10:14:58 <fleas> I'd like to see if I can get gentoo running on it
2008/01/10 10:15:07 <fleas> it might take me awhile though..
2008/01/10 10:15:15 <gavinstark> For me its BootCamp + migrating my old XP drive (if thats even possible)
2008/01/10 10:16:26 <fleas> It's a sin to install windows on a mac.. unless your job depends on it of course.
2008/01/10 10:16:47 <fleas> hey your blog doesn't have an "about me" link :)
2008/01/10 10:16:55 <fleas> Who are you? They all want to know!
2008/01/10 10:17:05 <gavinstark> Keeping things on the down-low....
2008/01/10 10:17:22 <fleas> But your in Tampa right?
2008/01/10 10:17:25 <gavinstark> Yep.
2008/01/10 10:17:42 <fleas> ahh.. I keep waiting for more Ruby folks to move to Sarasota
2008/01/10 10:17:47 <fleas> right now it's me and one other...
2008/01/10 10:17:52 <fleas> (that I know of)
2008/01/10 10:18:04 <fleas> all the sunjug has been talking about Ruby lately here.
2008/01/10 10:18:08 <gavinstark> I need to spend some more time on the blog, there are two big articles I've promissed the Tampa.rb crowd I'd write.  My TDD summary and a comparison of our Apache and Nginx configs.
2008/01/10 10:18:20 <fleas> always nice when a java user group talks ruby!
2008/01/10 10:18:46 <joydivider> gavin, how did last night go?
2008/01/10 10:18:50 <fleas> what do you mean a comparison? Benchmarks?
2008/01/10 10:19:22 <gavinstark> joy: We didn't do any coding, just talked Ruby/REST/programming in general.
2008/01/10 10:19:30 <gavinstark> feas: comparison of configuration formats.
2008/01/10 10:19:52 <gavinstark> Showing our "old" Apache configs and what we are using now.  There aren't a lot of great Nginx examples out there. (not enough anyway)
2008/01/10 10:19:52 <fleas> I've done a some nginx vs apache testing for our env recently...
2008/01/10 10:20:29 <fleas> but not a lot. One hold back I have been having is that nginx for whatever reason at times doesn't pay attention to my cached pages...
2008/01/10 10:22:04 <fleas> I like the fact that nginx uses less memory than apache .. but are then that I haven't been compelled to use it based on my benchmarks.
2008/01/10 10:22:54 <fleas> I like how easy it is to setup multiple apps behind a single nginx instance, but you can do that with apache vhosts just as well.
2008/01/10 10:23:27 <fleas> I guess since i have been using apache for 10 years, it's hard to switch. Plus I have plenty of ram in the servers I was talking about.
2008/01/10 10:25:09 <gavinstark> I like the "feel" of Nginx better than Apache, but there are a few detractors we've run into lately.  Upstream proxies aren't fairly balanced, but there is a patch for that.  Also there is no bandwidth throttling that can be specified across a "server" (host) -- only a per connection limit... We just put thttpd behind nginx and we are ok, but thats not a great solution.
2008/01/11 04:52:39 <self_up> brigadier
2008/01/11 10:49:51 <tehPope> does anyone know if ActiveSupport is threadsafe?
2008/01/11 10:50:02 <tehPope> or for that matter, how stuff can become thread unsafe?
2008/01/14 11:01:07 <fleas> mac pro on fedex truck!
2008/01/14 11:01:15 * fleas waiting for the truck to get here.
2008/01/14 11:01:46 <gavinstark> Excitement...
2008/01/14 11:01:57 <fleas> :P
2008/01/14 11:02:14 <gavinstark> I'm a "tracking number" watcher mysefl.
2008/01/14 11:02:14 <fleas> I can't wait..
2008/01/14 11:02:16 <gavinstark> myself.
2008/01/14 11:02:18 <fleas> hah
2008/01/14 11:02:37 <fleas> now what to do with my old Mac Pro :)
2008/01/14 11:03:03 <fleas> I don't know if you can really call it old, since I have had it for about 13 months.
2008/01/14 11:03:52 <fleas> gavinstark: also, last week when I bought it.. I bought Apple certified netlist memory (4GB for 279.00) from OWC, and now it looks like they raised the price to $329.00 :)
2008/01/14 11:04:16 <gavinstark> Jerks...
2008/01/14 11:04:45 <fleas> yeah, I almost waiting to buy the extra mem, I'm glad I didn't.
2008/01/14 11:05:33 <fleas> I also ordered separately the NVidia 8800GT from Apple, but it wont ship for another 4 weeks. Apple called me about it and told me that don't have the drivers done.
2008/01/14 11:21:08 <ambethia_> fleas: how mush you wanna sell the old one for?
2008/01/14 11:21:34 <gavinstark> be back later (lunch time)
2008/01/14 11:21:55 <fleas> not sure.. it's got 2 2.66 4GB ram, 2 optical drives, total disk space 750GB
2008/01/14 11:22:03 <fleas> I don't know what to ask for it
2008/01/14 11:22:05 <fleas> but I am fair
2008/01/14 11:22:15 <fleas> what do you think it's worth?
2008/01/14 11:22:25 <fleas> (truck just got here!!!!!)
2008/01/14 12:29:29 <filmprog> so does Joydivider leave for Portland tomorrow?
2008/01/14 12:49:58 <gavinstark> I heard the 19th?
2008/01/14 12:53:32 <filmprog> I had heard the 15th, but that was a while ago
2008/01/14 13:38:47 <ambethia> We went up there this weekend to find an apartment
2008/01/14 13:39:27 <filmprog> wha?
2008/01/14 13:39:33 <filmprog> are you going now?
2008/01/14 13:39:45 <ambethia> pfft no
2008/01/14 13:41:50 <filmprog> alright, good.  I need to have more live code reviews ;)
2008/01/14 13:53:22 <self_up> fleas, plugged it in yet? share the excitement
2008/01/14 13:54:35 <gavinstark> For some hilarity, google "networksolutions" now.
2008/01/14 13:54:51 <gavinstark> Look at their web site title as spidered:   "Site Temporarily Unavailable...."  Ha.
2008/01/14 13:56:10 <fleas> yeah just did:)
2008/01/14 13:56:36 <fleas> migrating my data over got a bit harry .. so I just popped out my old drives and put them in
2008/01/15 09:41:40 <bordy> mornin folks
2008/01/15 09:41:45 <gavinstark> Howdy.
2008/01/15 09:42:04 <bordy> how goes it?
2008/01/15 09:42:11 <gavinstark> Well, and you?
2008/01/15 09:42:22 <gavinstark> (waiting for noon to watch the Mac World keynote....)
2008/01/15 09:43:06 <bordy> meh. I was so proud of my progress before my vacation til I figured out I broke comments somehow while I was looking at it on the plane
2008/01/15 10:34:15 <fleas_> gavinstark: having any date/time related issues with your new mac pro?
2008/01/15 10:34:48 <fleas_> my clock seems to be running about 5 seconds to fast :) In other words, one minute on my box is actually 55 seconds.
2008/01/15 10:35:03 <fleas_> could be a bad battery, but I have a feeling that is not the case.
2008/01/15 10:35:42 <fleas_> (It's going to take me some time to get used to this little tiny keyboard.. since I have been using a Sun unix kb for over 8 years)
2008/01/15 10:36:00 <fleas_> I like the little kb though.. frees up a lot of space.
2008/01/15 10:40:12 <gavinstark> fleas:  Not that I'm aware of.
2008/01/15 10:40:25 <gavinstark> fleas: battery.  But I haven't looked too carefully.
2008/01/15 10:41:45 <fleas_> gavin, I figured it out because I have the old one and the new one right next to each other, and when I woke up this morning the new one's time was 2+ hours off
2008/01/15 10:41:52 <fleas_> and they both use the same NTP server
2008/01/15 10:42:18 <fleas_> I don't think it's the battery
2008/01/15 10:42:27 <fleas_> although it good be.
2008/01/15 10:42:46 <gavinstark> Was it sleeping during that time?
2008/01/15 10:42:52 <fleas_> nope
2008/01/15 10:43:05 <fleas_> plus it was 2 hours ahead not back
2008/01/15 10:43:15 <fleas_> I just tested it with a stop watch
2008/01/15 10:43:31 <fleas_> one minute on the new mac pro is actually 54.8 seconds
2008/01/15 10:43:38 <gavinstark> Now that is weird.
2008/01/15 10:43:42 <gavinstark> I'll have to try at home.
2008/01/15 10:43:43 <fleas_> I know
2008/01/15 10:43:56 <fleas_> callin gapple to let them know shortly
2008/01/15 10:44:11 <fleas_> other than that this box smokes
2008/01/15 10:44:49 <gavinstark> Yeah, X11 installed so fast I thought the install failed.  XCode and its friends installed in just under 4 minutes from DVD.
2008/01/15 10:44:50 <fleas_> On my old MP, if I do a full db restore (mysql 5) with all my indexes and data it takes about 56 minutes.
2008/01/15 10:44:56 <fleas_> On the new one, it took 27 minutes
2008/01/15 10:45:00 <fleas_> and that is with half the ram
2008/01/15 10:45:16 <fleas_> hah
2008/01/15 10:45:26 <fleas_> gavinstark: I'm also using leopard server
2008/01/15 10:45:39 <fleas_> I just pulled one of my drives from the old one and put it in
2008/01/15 10:45:47 <fleas_> could be a leopard server bug
2008/01/15 10:46:02 <fleas_> man 10.5.2 is pushing 400MB
2008/01/15 11:25:56 <fleas> grr
2008/01/15 11:26:01 <fleas> apple was clueless
2008/01/15 13:30:21 <gavinstark_> So who's going to buy that MacBook Air?
2008/01/15 13:30:33 <bordy> my boss, which will translate to me being able to buy his mbp
2008/01/15 13:31:08 <gavinstark_> I nailed the price.  Had a bet with a coworker.  He said $2299, I had it at $1799.
2008/01/15 13:31:43 <bordy> Now I might actually be tempted to buy an appletv
2008/01/15 13:34:50 <self_up> hey, meetup has feb 13 as next meeting. is possible there'll be a hacknight before then?
2008/01/15 13:35:46 <gavinstark_> Dunno, I was going to float the idea of trying to find a place on the St. Pete/Clearwater side of the bay for either the next meeting or the hacknights.
2008/01/15 13:47:14 <bordy> I can't get over the absence of an optical drive
2008/01/15 13:47:30 <bordy> if I am going to drop 1800 on a machine it had better replace my desktop (or at the least be as useful as my macbook)
2008/01/15 13:49:56 <bordy> grr, I screwed up my lil blog project, and because I didn't notice when I did it have already committed a few revisions that I don't wanna lose by reverting :-(
2008/01/16 06:58:41 <Haitek> bot
2008/01/16 06:58:44 <Haitek> bot
2008/01/16 06:58:49 <Haitek> airports suck
2008/01/16 06:58:53 <Haitek> just for the record
2008/01/16 20:55:11 <tehPope> yo
2008/01/17 14:23:24 <self_up> calling all capistrano know-it-alls
2008/01/17 15:08:13 <gavinstark> Howdy all.
2008/01/17 15:08:45 <gavinstark> Anyone here consider themselves a Javascript Guru?  (or know someone who is and might be looking for a bit of work?)
2008/01/17 15:28:31 <kedron> Becker is a JS STUD
2008/01/17 15:28:47 <gavinstark> And now he is moving away.... (or has moved)
2008/01/17 15:28:58 <kedron> so sad
2008/01/17 15:29:25 <gavinstark> I need someone to help me with a UI kind of like the one Picasa web uses for rearranging photo albums.  I can get close, but not quite as smooth.
2008/01/18 10:57:37 <bordy> So energetic in here! Calm down, folks
2008/01/18 13:17:39 <ambethia> we are so talkative today
2008/01/18 13:18:00 <filmprog> no we are not
2008/01/18 13:18:12 <ambethia> </sarcasm>
2008/01/18 13:18:45 <gavinstark> Turn the repo notifications back on, that brings some livelyhood.
2008/01/18 13:19:00 <ambethia> hahah
2008/01/18 13:19:01 <gavinstark> Or.... We could discuss trying to have a meetup on the St. Pete side of the bay.....  ;-)
2008/01/18 13:19:11 <ambethia> they are on, just not for any very active repos
2008/01/18 13:19:21 <ambethia> OOh
2008/01/18 13:21:39 <gavinstark> OOh?
2008/01/18 13:22:00 <filmprog> ooh
2008/01/18 13:22:05 <ambethia> st pete meetup
2008/01/18 13:22:05 <filmprog> I'm just parroting
2008/01/18 13:22:12 <filmprog> yea
2008/01/18 13:23:03 <filmprog> does anyone have a location?
2008/01/18 13:23:28 <ambethia> http://www.panerabread.com/cafes/meetings.php
2008/01/18 13:23:32 <gavinstark> I was thinking something right off the highway to make it easy.
2008/01/18 13:23:36 <gavinstark> Yeah, Panera is a good choice.
2008/01/18 13:23:43 <gavinstark> There is one right off ulmerton and 275.
2008/01/18 13:24:14 <ambethia> I wonder if they have a Community Room at that one
2008/01/18 13:24:32 <gavinstark> I think the Python group meets there.
2008/01/18 13:24:41 <ambethia> even if not we can take over some tables
2008/01/18 13:24:57 <filmprog> that would work for me
2008/01/18 13:25:11 <filmprog> the only issue was the ability to do projector type stuff
2008/01/18 13:26:29 <filmprog> for hack night stuff it'd be great
2008/01/18 13:26:36 <gavinstark> Yes, I think the projector type presentations are good, I wish my office had one, I'd bring it to some place that doesn't.
2008/01/18 13:26:45 <gavinstark> +1 for hack nights at a Panera/Starbucks.
2008/01/18 13:26:46 <filmprog> I have a projector myself
2008/01/18 13:27:00 <filmprog> all we need is power and a wall
2008/01/18 13:27:17 <ambethia> brb
2008/01/18 13:27:34 <filmprog> +1 for me on hack night at anywhere this side of the bay
2008/01/18 13:30:56 <gavinstark> I'd offer my office, but its too far off he highway and they turn off the AC at 7:00.    tinyurl.com/2g68ul
2008/01/19 18:26:06 <hotgazpacho> Ghost town this evening
2008/01/22 12:20:47 <gavinstark> Hey, anyone here feel up to a Prototype question?
2008/01/22 23:23:55 <bordy> fleas: evenin
2008/01/24 10:55:29 <bordy> mornin!
2008/01/24 11:29:22 <bordy> w00t, found a temporary textmate replacement :-D
2008/01/24 11:51:00 <self_up> what is it?
2008/01/24 11:51:14 <self_up> don't tell me it's called w00t
2008/01/24 11:51:21 <bordy> textflow
2008/01/24 11:51:29 <self_up> for which os?
2008/01/24 11:51:29 <bordy> my mac is in the shop :(
2008/01/24 11:51:36 <bordy> gnome
2008/01/24 11:51:41 <bordy> well, linux.
2008/01/24 11:51:43 <bordy> but gnome.
2008/01/24 11:52:06 <self_up> yep i'm using ubuntu, i believe this thing is called gnome
2008/01/24 11:52:45 <self_up> btw, tried Komodo? opinion?
2008/01/24 11:52:55 <bordy> I haven't. Should I check it out?
2008/01/24 11:53:11 <bordy> textflow's pretty awesome. I am on kubuntu, so it came with Kate which is nice, but textflow is much nicer
2008/01/24 11:54:33 <self_up> I've never used textmate or mac, so I suppose my standards are pretty low, but Komodo's impressing me so far
2008/01/24 11:57:42 <self_up> how's you get textflow, apt-got it?
2008/01/24 11:57:48 <self_up> *how'd
2008/01/24 11:59:06 <bordy> they have a sourceforge page, the newest version 0.2.2 doesn't have a deb, I installed 0.2.1
2008/01/24 12:02:47 <self_up> thanks
2008/01/24 13:59:08 <bordy> ambethia: who is hosting teh bot in here?
2008/01/24 13:59:12 <bordy> s/teh/the
2008/01/24 14:52:30 <ambethia> i am
2008/01/24 14:54:05 <bordy> might I grab a copy from you?
2008/01/24 14:56:19 <ambethia> of the bot?
2008/01/24 14:56:39 <bordy> yeah. was thinking of adapting it for #ubuntu-us-fl
2008/01/24 14:56:46 <ambethia> its Kirby
2008/01/24 14:57:12 <ambethia> look on rubyforge
2008/01/24 14:57:13 <bordy> well I say "I", I meant "I will pass it off to someone who can do it" lol
2008/01/24 14:57:52 <ambethia> gem install kirby
2008/01/24 23:44:21 <bordy> ambethia_ you alive?
2008/01/27 09:30:37 <madcowley>  welcome to the sunday morning ruby club.  please turn to chapter 12, verses 23-56 of The Ruby Way
2008/01/28 16:43:01 <filmprog> does anyone here use slicehost?
2008/01/28 16:43:11 <filmprog> because I'm about to sign up and I want to give them my referral
2008/01/29 09:17:56 <ambethia> morning playahs
2008/01/29 09:18:07 <gavinstark> Howdy.
2008/01/29 09:18:13 <ambethia> did everyone see I moved the date for Feb. meetup?
2008/01/29 09:18:25 <gavinstark> No, not yet.
2008/01/29 09:18:52 <ambethia> To thursday, but not the 2nd one, because that's V-day
2008/01/29 09:19:09 <ambethia> to the third thursday, like the 21st or something
2008/01/29 09:19:43 <gavinstark> The meetup says we are still meeting in the circular room.  True?
2008/01/29 10:27:27 <ambethia> oh i updated that just a bit a go
2008/01/29 10:27:41 <ambethia> we have the lounge
2008/01/29 12:56:38 <gavinstark> Are we going to retry the hack fest -- and are we still planning on creating the web site for the IRC logs?  As a suggestion I thought it might be nice to have a night where people can come and get help on their app, or any problem they have.  I know a few times people have asked me questions at the meetup, and here in the channel.  This is what I originally thought of for "hack nights" -- but the IRC log site is a good idea too.
2008/01/29 14:30:27 <filmprog_> i'm up for anything that's on this side of the bay
2008/01/29 14:30:58 <filmprog_> also, just in case anyone is interested I have a user group code for registering for RailsConf 2008
2008/01/29 14:31:00 <filmprog_> rc08usrg
2008/01/29 14:31:07 <filmprog_> gets you 15% off
2008/01/29 17:45:13 <gavinstark> I did my RailsConf registration this afternoon.  No way I'm getting locked out.
2008/01/29 18:05:31 <filmprog> sweet
2008/01/29 18:05:40 <filmprog> did you use th user group discount?
2008/01/29 18:06:48 <self_up> i'm using has many through, but i find i can add duplicate rows in my join table - anyone know how to enforce the uniqueness of two columns instead of just a single column?
2008/01/29 18:09:28 <Fishy5> Scope would work, I imagine.
2008/01/29 18:10:19 <gavinstark> film:  Yes, I used the discount, the user group one is 15% while the "I attended last year" was only 10%...
2008/01/29 18:11:19 <gavinstark> Anyone going to "acts as conference" next week in Orlando?
2008/01/29 18:11:33 <filmprog> i've been thinking about it, but prolly not
2008/01/29 18:11:55 <filmprog> i've got to head out... i'll log in at home in a bit.
2008/01/29 18:12:19 <Fishy5> Hrmm..  I'm going to it.
2008/01/29 18:19:14 <self_up> Fishy thanks, haven't learned about scope yet, one of my many missing pieces
2008/01/29 18:20:02 <gavinstark> Fishy: acts_as_conference?  Cool.  As its going to be a smaller conference I'm looking forward to it.  Sounds like 126 people max.
2008/01/29 18:23:38 <Fishy5> Wow..  I was expecting a larger crowd.
2008/01/29 18:24:37 <Fishy5> I knew it was going to be small, but figured at least 500..
2008/01/29 18:25:00 <gavinstark> I read somewhere "we are up to 100" and today "only 26 tickets left"
2008/01/29 18:31:22 <Fishy5> 150
2008/01/29 18:32:13 <Fishy5> http://groups.google.com/group/orug-discussion/msg/1cff1116204a7b81
2008/01/29 18:32:46 <Fishy5> But yeah, that's nothing.
2008/01/29 18:32:50 <gavinstark> Cool, 150 is a nice size.
2008/01/30 10:41:26 <filmprog> hey gavin... I am going to the acts_as_conference
2008/01/30 10:56:18 <gavinstark> film: cool.  I think we should try to recruit members for our meetup there.  Maybe there are folks who don't know about our awesome group.
2008/01/30 10:56:51 <gavinstark> I might try to contact Robert Dempsey and suggest that he give a few minutes/seconds to reference the local florida user's groups.
2008/01/30 11:32:41 <fleas> I think tampa.rb should move to Sarasota. K, thnx.
2008/01/30 11:33:41 <filmprog> yea right kthxbbqftw
2008/01/30 11:34:04 <fleas> Why does it appear that not many rails apps out their attempt to foil brute force logins, with something simple like lock_account after 5 failed passwords
2008/01/30 11:34:15 <fleas> s/their/there
2008/01/30 11:35:02 <fleas> I wonder how easy it would be to write a login cracker! I am such an elite haX0r.
2008/01/30 11:35:06 * fleas faints.
2008/01/30 11:36:01 <filmprog> maybe you should write that feature into acts_as_authenticated
2008/01/30 11:38:02 <filmprog> patch ftw!
2008/01/30 11:38:08 <fleas> filmprog: if I had time I just might!
2008/01/30 11:38:18 <fleas> I just spent a day working on it for our app
2008/01/30 11:38:37 <filmprog> there's always time... until you're dead
2008/01/30 11:38:51 <fleas> but our app is a bit more complex than most..
2008/01/30 11:38:59 * fleas salts his password and eggs.
2008/01/30 11:39:26 <fleas> filmprog: hmm, there is.. but then I would have to put all my open tickets aside
2008/01/30 11:39:55 <filmprog> you coming to the orlando conf, fleas?
2008/01/30 11:40:19 <fleas> ugh!
2008/01/30 11:40:41 <fleas> I want to, but we scheduled a trip to Honduras around the same time.. and i might just be too tired.
2008/01/30 11:41:19 <fleas> we are going village to village with my fiancee's father offering humanitarian aide, and frankly.. I am so out of shape.
2008/01/30 11:41:27 <fleas> (good excuse, right?)
2008/01/30 11:42:26 * fleas looks at his dog (Budward)
2008/01/30 11:43:09 <filmprog> life is not ALWAYS ruby
2008/01/30 11:43:15 <filmprog> Honduras sounds like fun
2008/01/30 11:43:29 <filmprog> we're thinking about going to Cancun and or Bahamas this year
2008/01/30 11:44:21 <budward> real memory  = 268435456 (256 MB)
2008/01/30 11:44:23 <budward> avail memory = 253075456 (241 MB)

2008/01/30 11:44:28 <fleas> weird
2008/01/30 11:44:29 <budward> real memory  = 268435456 (256 MB)
2008/01/30 11:44:31 <budward> avail memory = 253075456 (241 MB)
2008/01/30 11:44:32 <fleas> budward stop it!
2008/01/30 11:45:07 <fleas> filmprog: honduras is not going to be fun, it will be sad. At least we can do our part and help those poverty stricken
2008/01/30 11:45:33 <fleas> we are going on a medical mission, to provide aide to the poor.
2008/01/30 11:45:35 <filmprog> fleas I'm trying to pull my head out my ass...
2008/01/30 11:45:42 <fleas> I am not a doctor, but everyone in my family is
2008/01/30 11:45:47 <filmprog> that is very admirable dood
2008/01/30 11:45:58 <filmprog> that's awesome of you
2008/01/30 11:46:24 <fleas> it's awesome of my family, I am just going to be an assistant for a week
2008/01/30 11:46:40 <budward> CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU           X5472  @ 3.00GHz (2995.55-MHz 686-class CPU)

2008/01/30 11:46:40 <budward> CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU           X5472  @ 3.00GHz (2992.60-MHz 686-class CPU)
2008/01/30 11:47:42 <fleas> strange, I typed that stuff before I entered the room
2008/01/30 11:47:53 <fleas> I think I have a bug with my bot
2008/01/30 11:47:58 * fleas points to budward
2008/01/30 11:48:40 <fleas> man I still get so confused about rails.. I am such a newb.
2008/01/30 11:49:06 <fleas> I spent the weekend reading old documentation and fighting with fragment caching...
2008/01/30 11:49:09 <fleas> I hate that..
2008/01/30 11:49:25 <fleas> I highly recommend "the rails way". Obie rocks.
2008/01/30 11:49:55 * Haitek yawns
2008/01/30 11:50:18 * fleas looks at Haitek 
2008/01/30 11:50:22 <Haitek> Heheh
2008/01/30 11:50:26 <fleas> get up and walk around?
2008/01/30 11:50:47 <Haitek> Been fighting svn all morning
2008/01/30 11:51:00 <fleas> who's winning?
2008/01/30 11:51:05 <Haitek> samba
2008/01/30 11:51:40 <fleas> been fighting svn all morning and samba is winning? So your fighting with samba and svn?
2008/01/30 11:51:43 <fleas> or did you mean smb?
2008/01/30 11:52:19 <fleas> my favorite thing in the world is: "Resource limit matched Service mongrel_9005"
2008/01/30 11:52:20 <Haitek> have a checked out repo on a public share that 3 people update
2008/01/30 11:52:31 <Haitek> odd, I know.
2008/01/30 11:52:47 <fleas> mongrel_9005' total mem amount of 116268kB matches resource limit [total mem amount>112640kB]
2008/01/30 11:52:53 <fleas> blah@that
2008/01/30 11:52:58 <Haitek> Probably should teach them to check out their own local copies and I'll take care of refreshing the public share
2008/01/30 11:53:36 <fleas> Haitek: that will do nothing but cause major problems when all users commit code
2008/01/30 11:53:52 <fleas> unless your environments are identical, that is a recipe for disaster
2008/01/30 11:54:14 <fleas> meaning that you all use the same account
2008/01/30 11:54:32 <Haitek> naw, all different.
2008/01/30 11:54:38 <budward> FreeBSD mo.budward.net 6.3-RC2 FreeBSD 6.3-RC2 #0: Sun Dec 30 06:28:10 UTC 2007     root@dessler.cse.buffalo.edu:/usr/obj/usr/src/sys/GENERIC  i386
2008/01/30 11:54:58 <fleas> I think budward needs to go away and compile that GENERIC kernel of his.
2008/01/30 11:55:05 <Haitek> lol
2008/01/30 11:55:14 <Haitek> wth is he doing anyways?
2008/01/30 11:55:47 <fleas> he is running FreeBSD on his new mac pro 3.0 and glowing about it.
2008/01/30 11:56:06 <fleas> other than that, he just executes system commands right now...
2008/01/30 11:56:13 <Haitek> Wait, isn't osx basically freebsd anyways?
2008/01/30 11:56:15 <fleas> (randomly)
2008/01/30 11:56:32 <fleas> Haitek: it is, but you are talking about some major differences
2008/01/30 11:56:48 <Haitek> well, minus all the propietary crap crapple puts in there.
2008/01/30 11:57:10 <fleas> OSX has a BSD subsystem and mach kernel
2008/01/30 11:57:13 * Haitek grins
2008/01/30 11:57:37 <fleas> I'd like to think that osx is just FreeBSD with a more aesthetically pleasing interface, but it is a bit more than that.
2008/01/30 11:57:52 * fleas uses OSX for his man workstation
2008/01/30 11:58:01 <Haitek> Did they dump open darwin?
2008/01/30 11:58:40 <fleas> I don't think so, but I don't really pay attention to darwin
2008/01/30 11:58:57 <fleas> I don't really know all that much. I don't pay attention to anything..
2008/01/30 11:59:02 <Haitek> lol
2008/01/30 11:59:31 <fleas> well, I pay attention to open tickets, monit alerts and johan santana going to the mets.
2008/01/30 11:59:39 <fleas> other than that, I am braindead.
2008/01/30 11:59:52 <Haitek> open tickets, sounds like fun
2008/01/30 11:59:58 * fleas is a sys admin acting as a rails developer.
2008/01/30 12:00:23 <fleas> I should get a shirt that says, "I scale Rails!"
2008/01/30 12:00:33 <Haitek> unpossible!
2008/01/30 12:00:36 <fleas> scaling rails is much more difficult than scaling php.
2008/01/30 12:01:28 <Haitek> Isn't that why there's merb now?
2008/01/30 12:01:31 <fleas> its funny, I have read so much animosity between php'ers and rails'ers claiming mine is bigger than yours kinda thing.. but that kicker is...
2008/01/30 12:02:07 <fleas> I have worked for 2 large companys as Sr Sys Admin, in a LAMP env and a Rails env and they BOTH right shitty code!
2008/01/30 12:02:10 <fleas> fuck scrum!
2008/01/30 12:02:12 <fleas> brb
2008/01/30 12:04:39 <Haitek> If all coders were sys admins, then there wouldn't be these problem.s
2008/01/30 12:05:40 <Haitek> I play both roles at my job, so there tends to be a better balance.
2008/01/30 12:06:49 <Haitek> That is until corporate jams some purchased solution down my throat to deploy, then it's scrambling time to get some overpriced pos application in production.
2008/01/30 12:07:25 <Haitek> Written Solution > Puchased Solution
2008/01/30 14:02:42 <ambethia> whaatup paepol!!!
2008/01/30 14:06:13 <filmprog> sup sup
2008/01/30 14:06:23 <filmprog> you going to acts as conference next week?
2008/01/30 16:27:20 <ambethia> filmprog: I cancelled my registration
2008/01/30 16:27:46 <ambethia> My dad is coming to town, I havent seen him in years
2008/01/30 16:27:55 <filmprog> oh cool
2008/01/31 10:04:32 <ambethia> anyone know kedrons gmail address?
2008/01/31 10:38:35 <filmprog> sorry, I don't
2008/01/31 10:39:01 <filmprog> can you get it from the meetup user info?
2008/01/31 13:02:28 <gavinstark> Anyone here an Adobe Flash expert, or know one locally?  I'm looking for someone to hire for a small project to help develop content specs for a device my company makes that can play Flash 9.  I don't know enough to generate a "white paper" detailing to another Flash expert how to generate content that will look good given our CPU and video subsystem.
2008/01/31 23:34:35 <mcastilho> Looking for Rails consultant in Tampa bay.... anyone available ?
2008/01/31 23:37:28 <Fishy5> Depends on the details.
2008/02/14 10:39:00 Restarting
2008/02/14 10:39:00 Connecting
2008/02/14 10:39:12 <ambethia> WOO, he's back
2008/02/14 10:39:30 <ambethia> it only took me two weeks.
2008/02/14 10:44:31 <filmprog> grats
2008/02/14 10:46:00 <filmprog> hello brigadier... long time no see
2008/02/14 17:07:51 <madcowley> hi folks.  stupid question:  say, for instance, a friend of mine (i wouldn't do something like this) has svn set up for a project, and hasn't entered the authentication details since he set it up months ago; and, he can't remember what they are.  is there an osx/darwin file where they're stored somewhere?
2008/02/14 17:09:47 <gavinstark> Look in ~/.subversion/auth
2008/02/14 17:10:17 <gavinstark> Look through the subdirectories and see if anything in there jumps out at you.
2008/02/14 17:10:26 <gavinstark> I think that is where svn "caches" passwords and such.
2008/02/14 17:12:16 <madcowley> thanks.  "my friend" says that looks like it
2008/02/14 17:13:38 <madcowley> usernames are listed there, and passwords are in the keychain (duh)
2008/02/14 17:13:43 <madcowley> should have looked there first
2008/02/14 18:10:04 <MrSiebel> Hey whats up everybody?

2008/02/15 23:04:49 <BonzoESC> tampa > new jersey
2008/02/16 23:39:17 <BonzoESC> toilet humor let me in on this: http://poopstat.us/
2008/02/20 15:12:26 <bordy> mornin kids!
2008/02/20 15:19:36 <BonzoESC> howdy
2008/02/20 15:38:35 <bordy> Does ActionMailer make anybody else feel inferior? Cause it is ruining my sense of manliness.
2008/02/20 15:59:34 <filmprog> you're so weird
2008/02/20 16:02:20 <bordy> I was so proud of myself, did a bunch of stuff I'd never done before, and all without ambethia's help, and now I get hung up on this
2008/02/20 16:02:21 <bordy> grr
2008/02/20 16:03:30 <filmprog> what's the problem?
2008/02/20 16:05:02 <bordy> that I don't know, because I've never done this before. I am trying to write a simple trouble ticket app, where when a person submits a ticket, it mails it to our IT manager.
2008/02/20 16:05:24 <bordy> but I set it up with me as the admin for right now, and its not sending me an email.
2008/02/20 16:05:47 <bordy> followed this as a guide (and using gmail for mail... different guide) http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/HowToSendEmailsWithActionMailer
2008/02/20 16:12:53 <filmprog> hmmm
2008/02/20 16:13:00 <filmprog> that's a bitch of a page
2008/02/20 16:13:06 <filmprog> I read about half and I"m falling asleep
2008/02/20 16:15:15 <bordy> lol
2008/02/21 12:22:42 <gavinstark> Well, I'm off to lunch, Apple Store, my data center then the meetup tonight!
2008/02/21 16:39:24 <filmprog> i'm not going to be able to make it tonight
2008/02/21 16:39:31 <filmprog> asdf
2008/02/21 18:23:40 <gavinstark> filmprog:  So your not coming tonight?
